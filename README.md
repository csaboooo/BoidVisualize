Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds, and related group motion.

The algorithm is based on 3 simple rules:

separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates

alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates

cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
